# RUN SIMULATION

## Setup

```{r}
dependencies <- c(
  "devtools",
  "dplyr",
  "deldir",
  "ggplot2",
  "plotly",
  "foreach",
  "doParallel")
  #"ggvoronoi",
  #"gganimate")

for(dep in dependencies){
  if(!require(dep, character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(dep)
  }
}
```


## Run simulations
The function that performs Metropolis Algorithm is called "perform_simulations". With the same function we can perform both "static" and "bending" simulations. It returns the results, the parameters used and the algorithm. 
```{r}
PATH_MODEL = "tubular_simulations_source/model_execution.R"
source(PATH_MODEL)

params = list(
  seed = 1, # randomness
  n_steps = 3, # simulation steps
  n_cells = 100, # number of cells
  n_layers = 3, # numbers of layers
  apical_rad = 5/(2*pi), # apical radius
  ratio_rad = 2.5, # ratio between apical and basal radius 
  cyl_length = 10, # cylinder length
  gamma = 0.15, #  contractility
  lambda = 0.04, # adhesion 
  # elastic kappa = 1 cause adimentionality
  beta = 100, #constant involved in jumps because of perturbations
  s0_ratio = 1 # characteristic ratio between the actual radius and apical radius
  #BENDING
  #,omega = 1 #bending constant
  )

simulation <- perform_simulations(algorithm="static",parameters=params) 
#simulation <- perform_simulations(algorithm="bending",parameters=params) 

result_alg <- simulation$results
parameters <- simulation$parameters
algorithm <- simulation$algorithm
```

## Save Tesselation

Now, we select the tessellation that we want to save
```{r}
library(dplyr) # to do the filtering operation in the dataframe
dir.create(file.path("saved_tessellations/"))
PATH_FUNCTIONS = "tubular_simulations_source/save_utils.R"
source(PATH_FUNCTIONS)
pointsinit <- filter(result_alg[[1]], Frame ==1)
pointsend <- filter(result_alg[[1]], Frame==parameters$n_steps)
pts_info_init = save_tessellation_layers(pointsinit, n = parameters$n_cells, RadiusA =parameters$apical_rad, Ratio = parameters$ratio_rad,
                                     cyl_length = parameters$cyl_length, Layers = parameters$n_layers,
                                     filename = "saved_tessellations/init_saved_tessellation.csv")
pts_info_end = save_tessellation_layers(pointsend, n = parameters$n_cells, RadiusA =parameters$apical_rad, Ratio = parameters$ratio_rad,
                                     cyl_length = parameters$cyl_length, Layers = parameters$n_layers, 
                                     filename = "saved_tessellations/fin_saved_tessellation.csv")
```
And the same with bending, after getting the results, we extract the points (in the format list of dataframes) and we use the corresponding functions.

Then, to do the plots, we use the mathematica file with this input.

## Parallel execution

If we want to execute a parallel execution with multiple simulations at the same time, it is also possible with the following syntax. In this example, we use 3 clusters for execution (the default number of cores in ordinary laptops), and we want to perform different simulations changing the number of layers "L", but with the rest of parameters with default values. We could also perform all of the simulations with the same parameters, depending on the objective.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)

N_SIM = 3 # number of simulations
N_CLUSTERS = 3 # number of clusters
cl <- makeCluster(N_CLUSTERS) 
registerDoParallel(cl)

par_results <- foreach(i=c(1,2,3), .combine = rbind, .packages = "deldir") %dopar% {
  
 params = list(
  seed = i, # randomness
  n_steps = 20, # simulation steps
  n_cells = 10, # number of cells
  n_layers = 2, # numbers of layers
  apical_rad = 5/(2*pi), # apical radius
  ratio_rad = 2.5, # ratio between apical and basal radius 
  cyl_length = 10, # cylinder length
  gamma = 0.15, #  contractility
  lambda = 0.04, # adhesion 
  # elastic kappa = 1 cause adimentionality
  beta = 100, #constant involved in jumps because of perturbations
  #omega = 1, #bending constant
  s0_ratio = 1 # characteristic ratio between the actual radius and apical radius
  )

  do.call(perform_simulations,list(algorithm="static", parameters=params,save_parallel=TRUE))
}

stopCluster(cl)
stopImplicitCluster()
```

The following functions work only for parallel simulations using same number of cells and same number of steps. 

```{r}
PATH_SIMANALYSIS = "tubular_simulations_source/source_simulation_analysis.R"
source(PATH_SIMANALYSIS)

resord <- ord(par_results, iter = par_results[[1,2]]$n_steps, n=par_results[[1,2]]$n_cells, sim = N_SIM)

Am <- (2*pi*par_results[[1,2]]$apical_rad*(par_results[[1,2]]$cyl_length))/par_results[[1,2]]$n_cells
edgearsim<-funaux2simDOUBLE(resord,n=par_results[[1,2]]$n_cells,ps=N_SIM, A0=Am)

stationarylewis(edgearsim[[1]][1:(par_results[[1,2]]$n_cells*N_SIM),c(1,2,3)])

coef <- adjsim(par_results,nsim=N_SIM,it=par_results[[1,2]]$n_steps)
```


# DATA ANALYSIS

## Loading results

To load pre-existing results:
```{r}
# CHANGE file_name WITH THE CORRESPONDING PATH (check the folder results)
filename <- "results/static/results_simulation_24_10_25.RData"
simulation <- load_results(filename)

result_alg <- simulation$results
parameters <- simulation$parameters
algorithm <- simulation$algorithm
```

## Dataframe with history of points and  energy levels

Now we have the desired results stored in the variable "par_result_stat". Let's deep into this variable, which has 3 elements: the history of points locations in every step, the history of the energy at every step, and the value of nu squared, which is a metric over the topology of the surface.We see 3 columns. Every row represents a point, the columns "x" and "y"
represent the x and y coordinates of the point, and the column "Frame" 
respresent the step of the algorithm. So, if we have executed the code for 
50 steps and 100 cells, we will have 100x50 rows in total (points x steps).

```{r}
hist_points = result_alg$points_evolution
hist_points
hist_energy = result_alg$energy_evolution
```

We see that hist_energy contains simply 2 columns, one indicating the iteration 
(or step or Frame) and other indicating the energy after performing that number 
of iterations of Metropolis. In our case, if we execute the algorithm for 250 
steps we will have 250 rows.


## Energy levels plot 

The function energy_analisis_1sim  takes as argument the points in each iteration and returns the energy shelled by type in each iteration (an extension of the energy history). The columns represents the elastic, contractile and tensile energy, together with the sum of all (the total energy). The function plot_energyss takes the output of this function and makes a plot

```{r}
PATH_ANALYSIS = "tubular_simulations_source/source_analysis.R"
source(PATH_ANALYSIS)

enerhist_bytype <- energy_analisis_1sim(hist_points, it = parameters$n_steps, lay = parameters$n_layers, n =parameters$n_cells)
# knitr::kable(enerhist_bytype[1:3,], format="html")
plot_energyss(enerhist_bytype)
```

The function energy_analysis_nobend takes as argument the history of points in 1 simulations. Then it returns the initial energy decomposition by layers (separated by energy type) and the final energy decomposition (also by layer). The function also makes the 2 corresponding plots.

```{r}
results_analysis <- energy_analysis_nobend(histpts = hist_points, it = parameters$n_steps, n = parameters$n_cells, Lay = parameters$n_layers)
initial_energies <- results_analysis[[1]]
final_energies <- results_analysis[[2]]
```



The function energy_layers_sim_1 returns 1 dataframe with several columns, corresponding to the layers of the cylinder, and in every column we have the evolution of the energy along the specific layer. This funtion calls internally to the function energy_1_layer, that computes the specific energy of 1 layer in 1 given iteration.

```{r}
hist_layers<-energy_layers_sim1(histpts = hist_points, it = parameters$n_steps, Lay = parameters$n_layers, n = parameters$n_cells, rect = rec)
#knitr::kable(hist_layers[1:3,], format="html")
plot_energy_decomp(hist_layers)
```
