Tested on R version 4.3.1., RStudio version 2023.06.1+524. and Mathematica version 12/Wolfram Player version 14.2


## Installation ##

The code had been developped in R and the vizualization tool with Mathematica. Thus, you need to install R, Rstudio and Mathematica (if you have a licence) or Wolfram Player (free). In Windows and MacOs, no issues of installation had been reported. In Linux, you might face an issue with ``` gdal ```, that can be simply solved using the following commands:

``` sudo apt-get install gdal-bin proj-bin libgdal-dev libproj-dev ```
``` sudo apt install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev ```
``` sudo apt install --reinstall libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev pkg-config``` 

Please, conserve the same folder structure.
