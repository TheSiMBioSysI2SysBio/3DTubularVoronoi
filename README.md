## SIMULATING TUBULAR TISSUES IN 3D


The repository is a code repository that contains two main algorithms for simulation purposes. The first algorithm is the normal algorithm, which can be found in the "N-cylinder" folder. The second algorithm includes a Bending process and can be found in the "Bending algorithm" folder.

Both algorithms have two versions: a normal version and a parallelized version. The parallelized version allows for simulations to be executed in a distributed manner, which can improve the computational efficiency of the simulations.

In addition to the algorithms, the repository also contains scripts in the "Analysis" folder that are used to analyze the results of the code and produce output that is readable by other programming languages. The "Data" folder contains some sample data that has been executed and can be used for testing purposes.

Overall, this repository is designed to provide a flexible and scalable platform for simulation and analysis of various processes.
